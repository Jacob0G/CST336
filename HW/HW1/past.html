            <p>Within recent years, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has shown potential in improving medical research, exploring new developments in evolution, and other applications. Research such as Chiron reported convolutional neural network basecalling of nanopore raw signal data and produced reads with the greatest base identity to date (Teng et al., 2018).<br/><br/> Our aim is to incorporate similar methods for variant detection across multiple reads. We aim to achieve this by incorporating raw nanopore signal data into the feature set in variant detection models. <br/><br/>In conclusion, we hope that the improved performance of the nanopore variant detector will allow us to explore previously unreachable regions of the genome, or perhaps even enhance medical diagnostics for cancer and other genetic diseases. <br/><br/>Our preliminary results suggest that the nanopore sequencing data will help improve our nanopore variant detector models.
